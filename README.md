# Overview
This is the second Milestone Project within the Code Institues Full Stack Web Development programme which will create
a fully responsive, interactive website available across all devices and will focus on the Languedoc region in the 
South of France.  The objective of the website is to raise awareness of the tranquility of the region and to encourage 
the public to broaden their travel experience and learn how the Cathars lived in this forgotten part of the world.

*   **User Stories**

#   User Experience (UX)

###    1. The Strategy

*   The site has been developed to allow users to come, research, plan and purchase a trip with a difference.
*   It's aim is to provide a cultural experience in a region of France away from tourists in other popular areas of the country
and is suited to all age groups.
*   Due to the location of the castles away from the more conventional and popular resorts it will provide good value for money and 
an opportunity for visitors to experience something they will never forget.
*   The site provides details on a selection of five of the 12 Cathar Castles in the region and allows visitors to make informed decisions
about where they would like to go.
*   The site with be designed in accordance with the mobile first principles of coding which will also include interactive maps for each
castle location and surrounding area.
*   The contact form will allow the user to make enquiries and sign up to our database of users for travel literature and updates.

### 2. The Scope

*   The objective of the site is to build a concise and informative platform which will allow users to make well informed decisions about
whether they wish to travel to this region of France for a holiday with a difference.
*   I will be constructing the website using the HTML, CSS and bootstrap knowledge I have acquired and to incorporate new skills and knowledge
relating to JavaScript and the use of APIs.
*   It is intended the layout will be well spaced out with a good blend of text, imagery and maps to encourage the user to make plans that
will suit their budget, fitness and enthusiasm.
*   There will be the opportunity for the user to browse the social media links in order to review feedback from previous travellers and to 
join forums to allow them to ask questions to meet their concerns about the trip.

### 3. The Structure

*   The layout of the site will be consistent with the message the owner is trying to convey, that is, they would like to encourage people
to travel off the beaten track to try something different for their holiday.
*   The users will find that the site will be predicatable, as in, they will be able to follow the content from one page to the other with ease
and it will provide clear and intuitive feedback for what the user is looking for.

### 4. The Skeleton

*   This area will develop the content of The Structure a little further, the user will experience immediate value with links, imagery and 
maps laid out across the site.
*   The user will be leaving the site with a sense of positivity and curiousity of what could be the trip of a lifetime.
*   There will be progressive disclosure reflected across the site which will educate the user and provide subtle enhanced experience as they
navigate through the pages and the website.
